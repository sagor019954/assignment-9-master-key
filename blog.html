                    <h1>What is the difference between Localstorage and Sessionstorage?</h1>
                </div>

                    <h4>Localstorage:</h4>
                    <p>LocalStorage is a data storage type of web storage. This allows the JavaScript sites and apps to
                        store and access the data without any expiration date. This means that the data will always be
                        persisted and will not expire. So, data stored in the browser will be available even after
                        closing the browser window.It is an advantage of localStorage over cookies that it can store
                        more data than cookies. You can store 5MB data on the browser using localStorage.localStorage is
                        synchronous, which means that each operation executes one after another</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Sessionstorage:</h4>
                    <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin.
                        sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                        doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                        Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
                        created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that particular
                        tab.A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page
                        reloads
                        and restores.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Globalscope:</h4>
                    <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                        have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                        program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Blockscope:</h4>
                    <p>If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside a specific function then
                        those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which
                        is called the local scope</p>

                    <h4>Event Loop</h4>
                    <p>An event loop is a programming construct that allows a program to handle multiple events or tasks
                        simultaneously. It works by having the program keep track of all the events or tasks that need
                        to be processed, and then processing them one by one as they come in. This can be a very
                        efficient way to handle a lot of events or tasks, as it prevents the program from getting bogged
                        down by having to process everything at once.An event loop is a programming construct that
